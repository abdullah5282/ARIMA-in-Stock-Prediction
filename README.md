# ARIMA-in-Stock-Prediction
We have used ARIMA model to judge the seasonality trend of the stock price data and tried to predict the future trend of the same.
ARIMA was chosen as it is good on the seasonal data and was previosly used in predicting continous data.
The results are not very satisfactory when compared with other neural networks such as: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, etc.
